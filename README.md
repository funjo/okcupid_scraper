# okcupid_scraper
 
This is a web scraping project I did during the study at NYC Data Science Academy.

Demographics analysis (age and location distribution), along with some psychological analysis (who are pickier? who are lying?) are included. Analysis are based on 2,054 straight male, 2,412 straight female, and 782 bisexual mixed gender profiles.

Georeferenced heat map shows the user distribution around the world:
